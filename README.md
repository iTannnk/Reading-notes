#### Brief Intro
Hi my name is Dan. I am learning to code. 

Along with learning to code my passions include:
- Gaming
- Listening to music
- Talking with friends & family

In my free time I like to meditate and catch up on projects.

#### About Reading Notes
This markdown file has been made to demonstrate deployment witht the github pages and the basics of markdown.

#### Growth Mindset
A Growth Mindset means that you thrive on challenges and don't see failure as a way to describe yourself but, as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities and intelligence to be able to suit the enviroment you are in to fully optimise yourself to the highest extent of ones abilites. A Growth mindset can also further one's own goals and achievements because they know that they are capable of learning more, if they just put that extra effort in to see the "bright path ahead".

#### Blog Article
So far in my coding journey i have learned about something called UBUNTU which is what we can use to write "code". We use UBUNTU because the "code" we are writing is for linux. Since I am using Windows 10 UBUNTU acts as a virtual enivorment for linux which enables me to use this linux "code". 
**So what exactly is "code"** 
"code" is the language that we use to tell the programme in this case UBUNTU what to do! such examples can be as followed; 
- 'ls' =This will show you a list of all the current programmes that is in the directory you are in.
- 'cd' =Changing directory you want to be in.If Im in cd://users.Some folders like apps,downloads,images,music.Move to any with the command 'cd' then there name.
- 'pwd'=To help see which directory you are in its handy to know this useful command as path way directory (pwd) states where you are!

#### What Is Markdown?
Markdown is a language that was creating in 2004 by John Gruber. Ever since then Markdown is one of the worlds most popular markup languages. A feature of Markdown is you can use it to add formatting elements to plain text documents. Markdown is rather straight forward with how you want to set things out, like with most lay outs for text there is a title, header, sub-header and at times phrases or words you want to stand out in bold or be underlined if its a hyper-link.
For a header in markdown you would use the '#' symbol. Bold text is created by using '**' at the beginning and end of the word(s). For website design this may be easier then commands like <head><head/> as you the amount of characters used to get the command you want is greatly reduced.

#### So Why Use Markdown?
 As you could probably imagine there are several key reasons why one would prefer to use markdown over other text editors. here are some examples;
- Markdown is platform independent - This means that you can create Markdown formatted text on ANY device running any operating system!
- Markdown can be used for everything. The range of use is has it very vast, for instance people use it to create websites,documents,notes,books,presentations,email messages and technical documentation.
